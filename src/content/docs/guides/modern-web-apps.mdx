# Building Modern Web Applications

Modern web development has evolved significantly over the past decade. Today's applications need to be fast, responsive, and maintainable while providing an excellent user experience.

## Key Principles

### 1. Performance First
- **Core Web Vitals** - Focus on LCP, FID, and CLS
- **Code Splitting** - Load only what's needed
- **Lazy Loading** - Defer non-critical resources

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- **Graceful Degradation** - Work without JavaScript
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Mobile First** - Design for small screens first

### 3. Modern Architecture
- **Component-Based** - Reusable, maintainable code
- **State Management** - Predictable data flow
- **API-First** - Clean separation of concerns

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React/Vue/Svelte** - Modern component frameworks
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better DX
- **CSS-in-JS** - Scoped styling and theming

### Backend
- **Node.js/Python** - Fast, scalable runtimes
- **GraphQL** - Efficient data fetching
- **Microservices** - Modular, scalable architecture

### Infrastructure
- **CDN** - Global content delivery
- **Edge Computing** - Reduce latency
- **Monitoring** - Real-time performance insights

## Best Practices

1. **Start with a solid foundation**
2. **Optimize for performance from day one**
3. **Write tests for critical functionality**
4. **Use modern build tools and bundlers**
5. **Implement proper error handling**
6. **Monitor and iterate based on data**

## Tools & Resources

- **Build Tools**: Vite, Webpack, esbuild
- **Testing**: Jest, Vitest, Playwright
- **Linting**: ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint
- **Performance**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest
