# GitHub Pages Deployment Analysis & Fix

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### 1. **Missing Build Process**
- The project is an **Astro + Starlight** application, not a traditional static site
- The `dist/` directory was in `.gitignore`, preventing built files from being committed
- No build artifacts were present in the repository
- GitHub Pages was trying to serve source files instead of compiled HTML

### 2. **No Automated Deployment**
- Missing GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
- Manual build and deployment process required
- No automatic rebuilding when code changes

### 3. **Configuration Mismatch**
- Site configured for custom domain `about.techrich.net`
- CNAME file present but no build process to generate deployable files
- Astro configuration set for static output but not being built

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build with Astro
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 2. **Deployment Script** (`deploy.sh`)
- Automated build process for local testing
- Dependency management
- Build verification
- Clear deployment instructions

### 3. **Node.js Version Management**
- Added `.tool-versions` file for asdf
- Set Node.js version to 24.6.0
- Ensured consistent development environment

## 🚀 How It Works Now

### **Automatic Deployment Flow:**
1. **Code Push** → Triggers GitHub Actions
2. **Build Job** → Installs dependencies and builds with `npm run build`
3. **Artifact Upload** → Uploads `dist/` directory to GitHub Pages
4. **Deploy Job** → Deploys to GitHub Pages environment
5. **Site Live** → Available at configured domain

### **Local Development:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Deploy (runs build and shows instructions)
./deploy.sh
```

## 🔧 Key Configuration Files

### **astro.config.mjs**
- Static output mode enabled
- Starlight theme integration
- Custom domain configuration
- SEO and performance optimizations

### **package.json**
- Astro v5.6.1
- Starlight v0.35.2
- ProseMirror editor components
- Build and preview scripts

## 🌐 Deployment Status

### **Current State:**
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Site builds successfully
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow created
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed
- ✅ Automatic deployment triggered

### **Next Steps:**
1. **Monitor GitHub Actions** - Check Actions tab for build status
2. **Verify Deployment** - Site should be live in ~5-10 minutes
3. **Test Functionality** - Verify all pages and features work
4. **Custom Domain** - Ensure DNS points to GitHub Pages

## 🎯 Benefits of the Fix

### **For Developers:**
- Automated deployment on every push
- Consistent build environment
- Easy local testing and preview
- Clear deployment process

### **For Users:**
- Fast, reliable site updates
- Consistent performance
- Professional deployment pipeline
- Reduced downtime

### **For Maintenance:**
- Version-controlled deployment
- Rollback capability
- Build history and logs
- Automated testing integration

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If Deployment Fails:**
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Verify Node.js version compatibility
3. Check dependency conflicts
4. Review build output for errors

### **If Site Doesn't Load:**
1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled
2. Check custom domain DNS settings
3. Wait for DNS propagation
4. Review CNAME configuration

### **Local Build Issues:**
1. Clear `node_modules` and reinstall
2. Check Node.js version with `asdf current`
3. Verify Astro installation
4. Check for syntax errors in content
